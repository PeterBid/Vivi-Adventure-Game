## Motivation

I chose to create a theme based around the Final Fantasy series and the character "Vivi" from Final Fantasy 9 specifically. I made this decision as I believed that I could embrace my creativity, constructing a new scenario that both reflected similarities to the 'frogger' storyline while also embracing Final Fantasy. 

This is shown with the focus on adventures, overcoming various obstacles and an attempt to make it back home within a time limit.

With Vivi and his Allies under threat from numerous enemies, the aim of the game is to make them pass different bandits and monsters safely within a time limit and without losing all three lives. Along the way, they can ride a bird to aid their journey home.
